## The Git Worflow

We use git, and the Git Flow, AVH Edition : https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh

> `WARNING`! : The Git Flow, `AVH Edition` :
> * is an Edition of the well known original Git Flow,
> * is THE only one to use : because it is the only one maintained by the community since years (so it's got a lot of improvement)
> * see https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh

For all details, see [`./GIT_FLOW.md`](./GIT_FLOW.md)
